\arguments{
\item{i}{Individual}

\item{t}{time}

\item{x}{exposure}

\item{exposure_histories}{An array of exposure histories across all individuals, time steps and exposure events}

\item{biomarker_states}{An array of biomarker states (biomarker quantities) across all individuals, time steps and biomarker IDs}

\item{demography}{A tibble of relevant demographic information for each individual in the simulation.}

\item{biomarker_map}{A table specifying the relationship between exposure events and biomarker}

\item{model_pars}{A tibble of parameters needed for the immunity model}

\item{...}{}
}
\value{
A probability of successful exposure is returned
}
\description{
This immunity model should only be used for natural infection events. The probability of a successful exposure event is dependent on the individualâ€™s biomarker quantity at the time of exposure. User specified biomakrer_prot_midpoint and biomarker_prot_width within model_pars is used to calculate biomarker-mediated protection.
