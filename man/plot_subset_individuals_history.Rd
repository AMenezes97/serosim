\title{Plot biomarker states and immune histories for a subset of individuals}
\usage{
plot_subset_individuals_history(
  biomarker_states,
  immune_histories,
  subset,
  demography,
  removal = FALSE,
  heatmap = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{biomarker_states}{The reshaped data set containing biomarker quantities for individuals at all time steps for each biomarker}

\item{immune_histories}{The reshaped data set containing immune history for individuals at all time steps for each exposure event}

\item{subset}{The number of individuals you want to plot}

\item{demography}{Tibble of removal time for each individual}

\item{removal}{Set to TRUE if individuals are removed during the simulation and removal time is present in demogrpahy; defaults to FALSE}

\item{heatmap}{if TRUE, returns a heatmap of all biomarker states over time. Overwise plots each biomarker as a line.}

\value{
A plot of  biomarker states and exposure histories for a subset of individuals is returned
