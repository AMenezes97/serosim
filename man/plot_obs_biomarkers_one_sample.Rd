\title{Plot Observed Biomarker Quantities For One Observation Time}
\usage{
plot_obs_biomarkers_one_sample(
  observed_biomarker_states,
  add_boxplot = FALSE,
  add_density = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed_biomarker_states}{The reshaped data set containing observed biomarker quantities for individuals at all time steps for each biomarker}

\item{add_boxplot}{if TRUE, adds a boxplot to the jittered biomarker quantities with median and 75\% percentiles}

\item{add_density}{if TRUE, adds a smoothed density (violin) plot to the jittered biomarker quantities with 75\% quantiles}
}
\value{
A plot of observed biomarker quantities for all individuals and biomarkers is returned
}
\description{
This function should be used when there was only one time step in which biomarker quantities were observed
}
\examples{
