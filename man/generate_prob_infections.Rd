\title{Generate The Probability Of Infection At Each Time Step For All Pathogens}
\usage{
generate_prob_infections(
  FOIs,
  pathogens,
  overall_infection_probs,
  type = 1,
  times,
  set_prob1,
  set_prob2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{FOIs}{The Force of Infection at each time step for each pathogen; only needed for type=1}

\item{pathogens}{The number of pathogens}

\item{overall_infection_probs}{The cumulative probability of infection for each pathogen}

\item{type}{type=1 if you are simulating random FOIs, type=2 if you are inputting constant force of infection; default=1}

\item{times}{The number of time steps in the simulation}

\item{set_prob1}{The probability of infection for pathogen 1 at all time steps; only needs to be defined for type=2}

\item{set_prob2}{The probability of infection for pathogen 2 at all time steps; only needs to be defined for type=2}
}
\value{
The probability of infection at each time step for all pathogens is returned
}
