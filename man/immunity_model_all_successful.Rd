\title{Immunity Model Where All Exposures Are Successful}
\usage{
immunity_model_all_successful(
  i,
  t,
  e,
  exposure_histories,
  antibody_states,
  demography,
  antigen_map,
  theta,
  ...

}
\arguments{
\item{i}{Individual}

\item{t}{time}

\item{e}{exposure}

\item{exposure_histories}{An array of exposure histories across all individuals, time steps and exposure IDs}

\item{antibody_states}{True antibody titers for all individuals across all time steps and antigens}

\item{demography}{Demography information}

\item{antigen_map}{Object determining relationship between exposure IDs and antigens}

\item{theta}{Tibble including titer-mediated protection parameters}

\item{...}{}
}
\value{
A probability of successful exposure is returned
}
\description{
Probability of success is 1 so all exposure events are successful
}
