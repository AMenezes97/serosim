# Motivation 
The _serosim_ package is designed to simulate serological data arising from 
user-specified vaccine or infection-generated and antibody kinetics processes. 
_serosim_ allows users to specify and adjust model inputs responsible for 
generating the observed biomarker quantities like time-varying patterns of infection and 
vaccination, population demography, immunity and antibody kinetics, and 
serological survey sampling design in order to best represent the population and 
disease system(s) of interest.

Here, we will use the _serosim_ package to generate a simple cross-sectional 
serosurvey at the end of a 10 year simulation period for 100 individuals who 
have either been vaccinated, infected, both or neither. We will set up each of the 
required arguments and models for the _runserosim_ function in the order 
outlined in the methods section of the paper. We then run the simulation and 
examine its outputs.

In the _vignettes_ folder, you can find a more detailed walk through of this simple README simulation titled _Extended_README.Rmd_. 

There are three additional complex vignettes/case studies in the _vignettes_ folder. 

Case study 1 provides an example of a longitudinal singular biomarker serological 
data simulation structured around measles, a one-pathogen system with 
vaccination, but also applicable to other vaccine preventable diseases. 

Case study 2 provides an example of a cross-sectional multi-biomarker serological 
data structured around diphtheria and pertussis, a two-pathogen system with 
bivalent vaccination, but also applicable to multi-pathogen systems with multivalent 
vaccines. 

Case study 3 provides an example of a cross-sectional serosurvey of a one pathogen system with cross-reactive strains, modeled after influenza. This example tracks 3 circulating strains and strain specific biomarkers produced after infection. 

Case study 4 demonstrates how serological data simulated from a complex, realistic serosim model can be used to assess the accuracy of various seroepidemiological inference methods. 

# Installation
Load necessary packages:
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,eval=TRUE}
## Install and load serosim 
devtools::install_github("AMenezes97/serosim")
library(serosim)

## Load additional packages required 
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(reshape2)
```

# 1.1 Simulation Settings
We will simulate monthly time steps across a 10 year period.
```{r}
## Specify the number of time steps in the simulation
times <- seq(1,120,by=1) 
```

# 1.2 Population Demography
For this case study, we will be simulating a population with 100 individuals and 
we are not interested in tracking any demography information other than an individual's 
birth time.
```{r}
## Generate the population demography tibble
demography <- generate_pop_demography(N=100, times=times, prob_removal=0)
```

# 1.3 Exposure to biomarker mapping
Now we set up the exposure IDs and biomarker IDs for the simulation which will determine 
which infection or vaccination events are occurring. Here, we will simulate one 
circulating pathogen (exposure_ID=ifxn) and one vaccine (exposure_ID=vacc) both 
of which will boost the same biomarker, IgG titers (biomarker_ID=IgG).
```{r}
## Create biomarker map
biomarker_map_original <- tibble(exposure_id=c("ifxn","vacc"),biomarker_id=c("IgG","IgG"))

## Reformat biomarker_map for runserosim
biomarker_map <-reformat_biomarker_map(biomarker_map_original)
```

# 1.4 Force of Exposure and Exposure Model
Now, we need to specify the foe_pars argument which contains the force of 
exposure for all exposure_IDs across all time steps. The exposure model, specified within the _runserosim_ function in section 1.9, will determine the probability that an individual is exposed to a specific 
exposure event. 
```{r}
## Create an empty array to store the force of exposure for all exposure types
foe_pars <- array(0, dim=c(1,max(times),n_distinct(biomarker_map$exposure_id)))
## Specify the force of exposure for exposure ID 1 which represents natural infection
foe_pars[,,1] <- 0.01
## Specify the force of exposure for exposure ID 2 which represents vaccination
foe_pars[,,2] <- 0.1
``` 

# 1.5 Immunity Model
Here, we specify the immunity model which will determine the probability that an 
exposure event is successful in producing an immunological response. We will use a simple immunity model (immunity_model_vacc_ifxn_simple) where successful exposure is only conditional on the total number of previous 
exposure events. With this model, the probability of successful vaccination 
exposure depends on the number of vaccines received prior to time t and the 
individual's age at time t while the probability of successful infection is 
dependent on the number of infections prior to time t.
```{r}
## All models and arguments for this section are directly specified within the runserosim function belwo in section 1.9
```

# 1.6  Antibody Model and Model Parameters
Now, we specify the antibody model to be used within _runserosim_ to track antibody kinetics, or more broadly biomarker kinetics for each biomarker produced from successful exposure events. The antibody kinetics parameters are 
pre-loaded within a csv file. Users can edit the csv file to specify their 
own parameters.
```{r}
## Bring in the antibody parameters needed for the antibody model
## Note that the observation error parameter needed for the observation model (Section 1.7) is defined here too.
model_pars_path <- system.file("extdata", "model_pars_README.csv", package = "serosim")
model_pars_original <- read.csv(file = model_pars_path, header = TRUE)

## Reformat model_pars for runserosim so that exposure_id and biomarker_id are numeric and match the exposure to biomarker map
model_pars<-reformat_biomarker_map(model_pars_original)
```

# 1.7 Observation Model and observation_times
In this step, we specify the sampling design and assay choice for our
serological survey. We will take samples of all individuals at the end of the 
simulation (t=120). 
```{r}
## All models and arguments for this section are directly specified within the runserosim function belwo in section 1.9
```

# 1.8 Optional Arguments 
There are no optional arguments needed for this simulation. 

# 1.9 Run Simulation 
This is the core simulation where all simulation settings, models and parameters 
are specified within the main simulation function. Run time for this step varies 
depending on the number of individuals and the complexities of the specified models. 
There is a built in pre-computation step within _runserosim_ where the simulation attempts to perform as much pre-computation as possible for the exposure model to speed up the main simulation code. Users can turn off this pre-computation by setting pre-computation to FALSE within _runserosim_.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
## Run the core simulation and save outputs in "res"
res<- runserosim(
  simulation_settings=list("t_start"=1,"t_end"=max(times)),
  demography,
  observation_times=tibble(i=1:max(demography$i),t=120, b=1),
  foe_pars,
  biomarker_map,
  model_pars,
  exposure_model=exposure_model_simple_FOE,
  immunity_model=immunity_model_vacc_ifxn_simple,
  antibody_model=antibody_model_monophasic,
  observation_model=observation_model_continuous_noise,
  draw_parameters=draw_parameters_random_fx,

  ## Other arguments needed
  max_events=c(1,1),
  vacc_exposures=2,
  vacc_age=c(NA,9),
  sensitivity=0.85,
  specificity=0.9
)
```

# 1.10 Generate Plots
Now that the simulation is complete, let's plot and examine some of the simulation outputs.
```{r} 
## Plot biomarker kinetics and immune histories for 10 individuals 
plot_subset_individuals_history(res$biomarker_states, res$immune_histories_long, subset=10, demography)

## Plot the serosurvey results (observed biomarker quantities)
plot_obs_biomarkers_one_sample(res$observed_biomarker_states)
```
