#' Simple Immunity Model For Vaccination Events and Natural Infection Events
#' 
#' @description This immunity model should only be used with vaccines and natural infection. The probability of successful exposure for vaccination events depends on the number of vaccines an individual has received prior to time t and their current age. If the individual is under the maximum vaccinations allotted and is of an age eligible for vaccination then the probability of successful exposure is 1. The probability of a successful natural infection is dependent on the total number of infections that individual has experienced thus far. If the individual is under the maximum number of infections allotted then the probability of successful exposure is 1.
