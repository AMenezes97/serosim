Description: serosim is an open source R package designed to aid inference from serological surveys, by simulating data arising from user-specified vaccine and infection-generated antibody kinetics processes using a random effects model. serosim allows users to specify and adjust model inputs representing underlying processes responsible for generating the observed titer values like time-varying patterns of infection and vaccination, population demography, immunity and antibody kinetics, and serological survey sampling design in order to best represent the population and disease system(s) of interest.
