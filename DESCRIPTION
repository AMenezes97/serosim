Description: This package simulates antibody kinetics for a population by taking
  into account vaccination events, natural infection events, antibody waning, 
  titre-dependent boosting, force of infection, vaccination coverage, and 
  titre-dependent protection from infection. This package allows you to simulate
  serosurveys(observation process) by measuring titre levels at a given time 
  in a subset of individuals.
