# Motivation 
The _serosim_ package is designed to simulate serological data arising from 
user-specified vaccine or infection-generated and antibody kinetics processes. 
_serosim_ allows users to specify and adjust model inputs responsible for 
generating the observed biomarker quantities like time-varying patterns of infection and 
vaccination, population demography, immunity and antibody kinetics, and 
serological survey sampling design in order to best represent the population and 
disease system(s) of interest.

Here, we will use the _serosim_ package to generate a simple cross-sectional 
serosurvey at the end of a 10 year simulation period for 100 individuals who 
have either been vaccinated, infected, both or neither. We will set up each of the 
required arguments and models for the _runserosim_ function in the order 
outlined in the methods section of the paper. We then run the simulation and 
examine its outputs.

There are three additional vignettes/case studies in the _vignettes_ folder. 
Case study 1 provides an example of a longitudinal singular biomarker serological 
data simulation structured around measles, a one-pathogen system with 
vaccination, but also applicable to other vaccine preventable diseases. 

Case study 2 provides an example of a cross-sectional multi-biomarker serological 
data structured around diphtheria and pertussis, a two-pathogen system with 
bivalent vaccination, but also applicable to multi-pathogen systems with multivalent 
vaccines. 

Case study 3 provides an example of a cross-sectional serosurvey of a one pathogen system with cross-reactive strains, modeled after influenza. This example tracks 3 circulating strains and strain specific biomarkers produced after infection. 

Case study 4 demonstrates how serological data simulated from a complex, realistic serosim model can be used to assess the accuracy of various seroepidemiological inference methods. 

# Installation

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,eval=TRUE}
## Install and load serosim 
## devtools::install_github("seroanalytics/serosim")
library(serosim)

## Load additional packages required 
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(reshape2)
```


# 1.1 Simulation Settings
We will simulate monthly time steps across a 10 year period. Therefore, we will 
have 120 time steps. Note that these are arbitrary time steps which will need to 
be scaled to the right time resolution to match any time-based parameters used 
later on.
```{r}
## Specify the number of time steps in the simulation
times <- seq(1,120,by=1) 

## Set simulation settings argument needed for runserosim 
simulation_settings <- list("t_start"=1,"t_end"=max(times))
```

# 1.2 Population Demography
For this case study, we will be simulating a population with 100 individuals and 
we are not interested in tracking any demography information other than an individual's 
birth time. We will use the generate_pop_demography function to create the 
demography tibble needed for _runserosim_. 

Note: The _runserosim_ function only requires a demography tibble 
with two columns (individuals and times). In this case it will assume all individuals 
are born at the start of the simulation period. 
```{r}
## Generate the population demography tibble
## Specify the number of individuals in the simulation; N=100
## No individuals are removed from the population; prob_removal=0
demography <- generate_pop_demography(N=100, times=times, prob_removal=0)

## Examine the generated demography tibble
summary(demography)
```

# 1.3 Exposure to biomarker mapping
Now we set up the exposure IDs and biomarker IDs for the simulation which will determine 
which infection or vaccination events are occurring. Here, we will simulate one 
circulating pathogen (exposure_ID=ifxn) and one vaccine (exposure_ID=vacc) both 
of which will boost the same biomarker, IgG titers (biomarker_ID=IgG). This 
biomarker map can be used for any simulations of vaccine preventable diseases 
like measles vaccination and measles natural infection. _runserosim_ requires that 
exposure_id and biomarker_id are numeric so we will use the
reformat_biomarker_map function to create a new version of the biomarker map. 
Users can go directly to numeric biomarker_map if they wish.

Note that the reformat_biomarker_map function  will number the exposures and 
biomarkers in alphabetical order so that the first exposure event or biomarker 
that is listed will not necessarily be labeled as 1.
```{r}
## Create biomarker map
biomarker_map_original <- tibble(exposure_id=c("ifxn","vacc"),biomarker_id=c("IgG","IgG"))
biomarker_map_original

## Reformat biomarker_map for runserosim
biomarker_map <-reformat_biomarker_map(biomarker_map_original)
biomarker_map
```

# 1.4 Force of Exposure and Exposure Model
Now, we need to specify the foe_pars argument which contains the force of 
exposure for all exposure_IDs across all time steps. We also specify the 
exposure model which will be called within _runserosim_ later. The exposure model 
will determine the probability that an individual is exposed to a specific 
exposure event. 
Since we did not specify different groups within demography, all individuals will 
automatically be assigned group 1. Therefore, we only need 1 row for dimension
1 in foe_pars. Groups can be used as an indicator of location if the user wishes to 
specify a location specific force of exposure. Dimension 3 of the foe_array must be in the same order as the exposure_id within the biomarker map. For example, the force of exposure 
for exposure_id 1 will be inputted within the foe_pars[,,1]. We specified the same force of exposure 
for all time steps within foe_pars for simplicity but users will likely have 
varying numbers to match real world settings. 
```{r, fig.dim = c(4, 3)}
## Create an empty array to store the force of exposure for all exposure types
foe_pars <- array(0, dim=c(1,max(times),n_distinct(biomarker_map$exposure_id)))
## Specify the force of exposure for exposure ID 1 which represents natural infection
foe_pars[,,1] <- 0.01
## Specify the force of exposure for exposure ID 2 which represents vaccination
foe_pars[,,2] <- 0.1

## Specify a simple exposure model which calculates the probability of exposure directly from the force of exposure at that time step. In this selected model, the probability of exposure is 1-exp(-FOE) where FOE is the force of exposure at that time.
exposure_model<-exposure_model_simple_FOE

## Examine the probability of exposure over time for the specified exposure model and foe_pars array
plot_exposure_model(exposure_model=exposure_model_simple_FOE, times=times, n_groups = 1, n_exposures = 2, foe_pars=foe_pars)
``` 

# 1.5 Immunity Model
Here, we specify the immunity model which will determine the probability that an 
exposure event is successful in producing an immunological response. We will use a simple immunity model (immunity_model_vacc_ifxn_simple) 
where successful exposure is only conditional on the total number of previous 
exposure events. With this model, the probability of successful vaccination 
exposure depends on the number of vaccines received prior to time t and the 
individual's age at time t while the probability of successful infection is 
dependent on the number of infections prior to time t.
```{r}
## Specify immunity model within runserosim function below 
immunity_model<-immunity_model_vacc_ifxn_simple

## Create 3 additional arguments needed for this immunity model 
## Specify which exposure IDs represent vaccination events 
vacc_exposures<-2
## Specify the age at which an individual is eligible for vaccination (9 months old); note non vaccine exposures are listed as NAs
vacc_age<-c(NA,9)
## Specify the maximum number of successful events an individual can receive for each exposure type (1 infection event and 1 vaccination event)
max_events<-c(1,1)
```

# 1.6  Antibody Model and Model Parameters
Now, we specify the antibody model to be used within _runserosim_ to track antibody kinetics, or more broadly biomarker kinetics for each biomarker produced from successful exposure events. We will be using 
a monophasic boosting-waning model in this example. This model assumes that for each exposure there is a boost and boost waning parameter. The antibody kinetics parameters are 
pre-loaded within a csv file. Users can edit the csv file to specify their 
own parameters. All parameters needed for the user specified antibody model 
must be specified within the model_pars. 
Lastly, we define the draw_parameters function which determines how each 
individual’s antibody kinetics parameters are simulated from the within-host 
processes parameters tibble (model_pars). We will use a function which draws 
parameters directly from model_pars for the antibody model with random 
effects to represent individual heterogeneity in immunological responses. 
Parameters are drawn randomly from a distribution with mean and standard 
deviation specified within model_pars. _runserosim_ requires that exposure_id and biomarker_id 
within model_pars are numeric and match the exposure to biomarker map so we will use the reformat_biomarker_map function again to create a new 
version of model_pars. Users can go directly to numeric model_pars if they wish.
```{r, fig.dim = c(5, 4)}
## Specify the antibody model 
antibody_model<-antibody_model_monophasic

## Bring in the antibody parameters needed for the antibody model
## Note that the observation error parameter needed for the observation model (Section 1.7) is defined here too.
model_pars_path <- system.file("extdata", "model_pars_README.csv", package = "serosim")
model_pars_original <- read.csv(file = model_pars_path, header = TRUE)
model_pars_original 

## Reformat model_pars for runserosim
model_pars<-reformat_biomarker_map(model_pars_original)
model_pars

## Specify the draw_parameters function
draw_parameters<-draw_parameters_random_fx

## Plot example biomarker trajectories given the specified antibody kinetics model, model parameters and draw parameters function 
plot_antibody_model(antibody_model_monophasic, N=100, model_pars=model_pars,draw_parameters_fn = draw_parameters_random_fx, biomarker_map=biomarker_map)

```

# 1.7 Observation Model and observation_times
Now we specify how observed biomarker quantities are generated as a probabilistic 
function of the true, latent biomarker quantity and when to observe these quantities.
In this step, we specify the sampling design and assay choice for our
serological survey. We will take samples of all individuals at the end of the 
simulation (t=120). 

Our chosen observation model observes the latent biomarker quantity given a 
continuous assay with added noise. The added noise represents assay variability 
and is implemented by sampling from a distribution with the true latent biomarker
quantity as the mean and the measurement error as the standard deviation. The 
observation standard deviation and distribution are defined within model_pars as 
the “obs_sd” parameter. Within this observation model, we can also specify 
the assay sensitivity and specificity. 
```{r}
## Specify the observation model 
observation_model<-observation_model_continuous_noise

## Specify assay sensitivity and specificity needed for the observation model
sensitivity<-0.85
specificity<-0.9

## Specify observation_times (serological survey sampling design) to observe biomarker 1 across all individuals at the end of the simulation (t=120)
observation_times<- tibble(i=1:max(demography$i),t=120, b=1)
```

# 1.8 Optional Arguments 
There are no optional arguments needed for this simulation. 

# 1.9 Run Simulation 
This is the core simulation where all simulation settings, models and parameters 
are specified within the main simulation function. Run time for this step varies 
depending on the number of individuals and the complexities of the specified models. 
There is a built in pre-computation step within _runserosim_ where the simulation attempts to perform as much pre-computation as possible for the exposure model to speed up the main simulation code. Users can turn off this pre-computation by setting pre-computation to FALSE within _runserosim_.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
## Run the core simulation and save outputs in "res"
res<- runserosim(
  simulation_settings,
  demography,
  observation_times,
  foe_pars,
  biomarker_map,
  model_pars,
  exposure_model,
  immunity_model,
  antibody_model,
  observation_model,
  draw_parameters,

  ## Other arguments needed
  max_events=max_events,
  vacc_exposures=vacc_exposures,
  vacc_age=vacc_age,
  sensitivity=sensitivity,
  specificity=specificity
)

## Note that models and arguments specified earlier in the code can be specified directly within this function.
```

# 1.10 Generate Plots
Now that the simulation is complete, let's plot and examine the simulation outputs.
```{r, fig.dim = c(6, 4)} 
## Plot biomarker kinetics and immune histories for 10 individuals 
plot_subset_individuals_history(res$biomarker_states, res$immune_histories_long, subset=10, demography)
```

```{r, fig.dim = c(4, 6)}
## Plot individual force of exposure for all exposure types
## This is the output of the exposure model.
## Note: All individuals are under the same force of exposure since we specified a simple exposure model and constant foe_pars
plot_exposure_force(res$exposure_force_long)

## Plot individual successful exposure probabilities for all exposure types
## This is the output of the exposure model multiplied by the output of the immunity model.
## In other words, this is the probability of an exposure event being successful and inducing an immunological response
plot_exposure_prob(res$exposure_probabilities_long)

## Plot individual immune histories for all exposure types
plot_immune_histories(res$immune_histories_long)

## Plot true biomarker quantities for all individuals across the entire simulation period
plot_biomarker_quantity(res$biomarker_states)

## Plot the serosurvey results (observed biomarker quantities)
plot_obs_biomarkers_one_sample(res$observed_biomarker_states)

## Note that the simulated kinetics parameters are also stored
head(res$kinetics_parameters)

## Combine plots as seen in paper 
# library(cowplot)
# plot_grid(plot_exposure_prob(res$exposure_probabilities_long), plot_immune_histories(res$immune_histories_long), nrow=1, ncol=2, align = "hv", scale=c(.98,.98))
# plot_grid(plot_biomarker_quantity(res$biomarker_states), plot_obs_biomarkers_one_sample(res$observed_biomarker_states), nrow=1, ncol=2, align = "hv", scale=c(.98,.98))
```
